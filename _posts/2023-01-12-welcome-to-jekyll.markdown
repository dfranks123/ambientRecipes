So uh, new things... the inauguration of stuff. I never really fully know how to feel about the start of something, especially when that immediate dismi


Recently I was having a conversation with a guy who was high-up on the tech side of a corporation. One moment stuck out. When he asked point-blank, "so you use the iterative process?". Like what kind of question is that? Is that a rhetorical question (expecting I'm the idiot), or is it a genuine question (they're the idiot) or is there some sort of hidden sub text I just wasn't understanding. He then went on to assume that by my response of a simple 'yes' this was a greenlight to assume I was using the 'agile' workflow or some other bureaucratic bs (okay this is a tad hyperbolic). Now, you might assume, a simple 'yes' was a little nonchalant, but this whole time I'm just trying to process all the potential meanings of what he said. Dude, you use the iterative approach, that's revolutionary, I've never heard of that!. Perhaps that was what he was getting at, like it's some sort of revelation that for things to change, they're iterated on - maybe that's why there are so many monolithic software companies nowadays. 'Rome wasn't built in a day', ['time moves slow'], 'many hands make light work' ad infinitum. I'm not sure how I feel about [tech debt] but it's certainly a thing and it'll certainly be looked back on and laughed at, just like anything else. It's purely a symptom of dilution, a lack of necessity - I love this element of the 'start-up mindset', 'fuck that, we have to do this otherwise we'll be out of business tomorrow'.

People just can't believe or are just not willing to believe things will change - that when ideas have a direction - and then given momentum - it'll take more energy than it has to knock it off course. In some ways it's scary, I get it, and there's reason to be scared. Take the [Fermi Paradox], "But where is everybody?". 


 LOVE  the way it all ends; with a proud "I chose you", because making such a decision sometimes  feels like the only important and equally liberating decision of our lives—to choose who we think deserves our  time, our love, and our energy.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{gay}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
